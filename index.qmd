I was born in São Paulo, Brazil, and received the Applied Mathematics degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)) in 2011, the M.Sc. degree from IM/UFRJ in Applied Mathematics in 2013 (monograph in Portuguese - [An Introduction to Singularities in General Relativity](http://objdig.ufrj.br/11/dissert/795029.pdf)), and finally the D.Sc. degree from COPPE/UFRJ in Electrical Engineering, area Signal Processing, being supervised by [Luiz Wagner Pereira Biscainho](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1765239890846505) and [Flávio Rainho Ávila](http://lattes.cnpq.br/6480915325344415) (thesis in English - [Bayes Meets Bach: Applications of Bayesian Statistics to Audio Restoration](http://www.pee.ufrj.br/index.php/pt/producao-academica/teses-de-doutorado/2017-1/2016033153-bayes-meets-bach-applications-of-bayesian-statistics-to-audio-restoration/file)). I am Assistant Professor of the [Department of Statistical Methods](http://www.dme.ufrj.br/) from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, member of the [MusMat Research Group](https://musmat.org/) and member of the editorial board of [MusMat • Brazilian Journal of Music and Mathematics](https://musmat.org/en/musmat-journal/). Fortunately, I am able to merge my passions in my work: Music and Mathematics, being applications of Statistics to this fascinating intersection my main research interest. I am also interested in Music Information Retrieval, Statistical Signal Processing and Computational Statistics. In my spare time I like to brew beer at home with my wife, play classical guitar, learn how to play the harmonica, study music composition (and compose!) and paint in watercolor. I am also an enthusiast of science fiction (specially the Star Trek universe) and J. R. R. Tolkien *legendarium*.
